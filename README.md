# CovidDefender
## Mission Statement

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease still remain a public threat to the public a year after the first case declared in Toronto. With vaccination on the horizon, we now have a effective weapon against the virus. 

However, research shows with a highly contagious disease, a localized approach is more important than a high vaccination rate nationally. Some government like US Biden Biden Administration are planning a Community Approach to vaccinate the population and to promote Covid-19 vaccine. 

Therefore, we would like to identify areas with low level of public transit and high Covid-19 infection. Community organization can promote localized vaccination in less accessible location. 
 
## App description and features
 
Our app, *CovidDefender* hope can help governemnt and social work organization to promoting vaccination and ultimately foster better community relationship.
